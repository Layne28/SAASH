# Self Assembly Analysis Script for HOOMD (SAASH)

This repository contains a general analysis script for tracking the progress of self-assembling subunits simulated using HOOMD. 

The user provides an input interaction file that lists all the pairs of pseudoatoms that are responsible for bonds in addition to the cutoff distance for that interaction. User can optionally provide a pseudoatom label for any nanoparticles in the domain and their radii, enabling the tracking of the largest cluster assembled around the nanoparticle. 

To be added to later.
